This repository utilizes the VAE (Variational Autoencoder) technique to cluster radar signals from ships. Through experimentation, it has been observed that applying this technique significantly improves the accuracy compared to the conventional machine learning method of K-means clustering. The GitHub repository contains the code and files related to the implementation of the VAE-for-clustering approach.
